## Thanks
This project is inspired by shekhargulati's [little-java-functions](https://github.com/shekhargulati/little-java-functions).
And his project is started as a Java fork of [30-seconds-of-code](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/30-seconds-of-code)

I'm planning to start implementing functions in little-java-functions project in Scala style.
After that, I'll write my own functions. This project is just for my study and welcome PR and Issue for my bad implementation.
